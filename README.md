Python Keyword Guessing Game is a simple but fun program that helps players learn Python keywords in an interactive way. It uses Tkinter to create a graphical interface where a random Python keyword is selected, and the player has to guess it based on a clue. The game starts with a welcome screen, and when the player clicks "Start," they see a word hidden by underscores and a hint describing what it does in Python. The player types their guesses, and the program updates the display, revealing correct letters. If they guess the word correctly, they win; if they use all five attempts, the correct word is shown, and the game restarts with a new word.

My code follows an object-oriented programming (OOP) approach, with a WordGuessingGame class handling all the game logic. Functions like setup_ui(), new_game(), and process_guess() manage different parts of the game, keeping everything organized. The program makes use of basic Python features like dictionaries to store keywords and their descriptions, if-else statements for game logic, and try-except-finally for error handling. The interface is built using Tkinter widgets such as Label, Button, and Entry to create a responsive and user-friendly design.
